    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p1>
      I'm Jashanpreet Singh, a 20yo from Punjab, India, with big dreams. I finished high school in 2023 from <abbr title="Army public school">APS</abbr> Public School, Amritsar. I got access to the internet in 6<sup>th</sup> grade when YouTube was getting popular in India. I was super curious about what I could do online, so I started learning video editing and even picked up Photoshop.

      In 9th grade, I chose Computer IT as my optional subject, and thats when I got into coding. In 2023, I started a YouTube channel and hit 589 subscribers with 107K views in just three months. I was so happy, but my parents wasn't. They thought I was wasting time, so they decided to send me abroad.
